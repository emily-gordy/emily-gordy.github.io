### Welcome to my research website! 

#### I am a Data Science postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University in the Department of Earth System Science interested in climate variability and predictability, as well as fun, throughtful applications of machine learning to learn about climate change. 

#### In August 2025 I will be starting a faculty position at the University of Auckland. I am looking to work with people interested in:
* #### large scale climate variability and change,
* #### regional climate change and impacts,
* #### predictability theory,
* #### AI applications to predictability.
